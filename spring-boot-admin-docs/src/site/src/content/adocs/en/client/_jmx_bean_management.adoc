== JMX-Bean Management

WARNING: Spring Boot 3 does currently not support Jolokia, so this will not work with Spring Boot 3 based applications.
You can still monitor Spring Boot 2 applications with Jolokia endpoint using a Spring Boot Admin 3 server.

To interact with JMX-beans in the admin UI you have to include https://jolokia.org/[Jolokia] in your application.
As Jolokia is servlet based there is no support for reactive applications.
In case you are using the `spring-boot-admin-starter-client` it will be pulled in for you, if not add Jolokia to your dependencies.
With Spring Boot 2.2.0 you might want to set `spring.jmx.enabled=true` if you want to expose Spring beans via JMX.
