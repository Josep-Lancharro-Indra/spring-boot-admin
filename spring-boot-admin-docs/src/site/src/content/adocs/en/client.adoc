== Spring Boot Admin Client
Spring Boot Admin Client registers the application at the admin server.
This is done by periodically doing a HTTP post request to the SBA Server providing information about the application.

TIP: There are plenty of properties to influence the way how the SBA Client registers your application.
In case that doesn't fit your needs, you can provide your own `ApplicationFactory` implementation.
